          We develop based on the scientific method. A thesis is formed,
          based on observation and logic. A priori investment recommendations are selected
          in a randomized double blind controlled trial. A posteriori results determine the
          validity of the thesis tested in comparison with a baseline.<br/><br/>

          By accepting or rejecting thesis' numbering in the thousands,
          with quantitative hard data, we have advanced the basic knowledge in our
          field over the last 14 years. The speed of the process has been greatly
          accelerated by machine learning.<br/><br/>

          All scientific studies are performed in an environment,
          specifically built so as to be non-biased in every possible respect.
