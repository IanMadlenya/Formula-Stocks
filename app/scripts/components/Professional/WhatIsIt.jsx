          We specialize in a new breed of advanced investment strategies, establishing
          outperformance through an informational advantage.<br/><br/>

          14 years ago we started a product development cycle using machine learning – well ahead of most industry
          participants. We would like to invite you on a tour of an idea and a groundbreaking product that may be able to
          assist you in obtaining better performance for you or your customers.<br/><br/>

          We call it Formula Stocks.<br/><br/>

          What does it do? It beats the market by understanding businesses and strategies better than the competition,
          thus gaining a durable informational advantage or edge.<br/><br/>

          How does it do it? Formula Stocks uses expert systems, big data, and machine learning to develop a set of
          technologies, which we label Intelligent Investment Technology™ or IIT™. Through this technology we have
          learned more about what really works in certain equity investing contexts than is generally known, and upon this solid
          foundation we have built new and better investment methods.<br/><br/>

          How can it help you or your customers? We offer products that can improve return on capital, whether personal,
          corporate, or institutional. You can subscribe to recommendations based on the technology, which has
          outperformed the S&P 500 89% of the time for the last 45 years.<br/><br/>

          Recommendations are based on sound business and investment logic.
