          Users can access the results of up to 94 different Intelligent Investment Technologies,
          or IITs for short. IITs are methods for outperforming the market. An IIT is specialized
          in one field or another, capable of making superior decisions in this particular field
          due to deep expert knowledge acquired. Due to deep expert specialization,
          IITs are extremely capable within their field. IITs can work in any number of ways,
          and within as many different investment disciplines- but they always have one basic
          attribute in common: The mathematical probabilities and statistical properties of any
          IIT define it as being capable of beating the general market, even on its own.<br/><br/>

          Generally, IIT decisions are made when mathematical and statistical properties
          indicate 90%+ probability a priori for winning over the long run.
          Win ratio expectations has typically been observed around this approximate
          level a posteori.

          is a testament to the ruggedness of our approach. It will not suddenly be
          arbitraged away, falter due to macroeconomic change, or cease to be relevant."
