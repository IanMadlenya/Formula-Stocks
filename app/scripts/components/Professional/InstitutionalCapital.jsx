          For institutional capital, liquidity is more important than performance.
          Our FUND product reflects this, it is designed to dynamically scale its
          recommandations towards a specific AUM target provided by our members,
          to always ensure ample liquidity for a specific size, without affecting a
          significant market impact, and for optimal perfomance. Our method of
          accumulation and distribution works towards leaving as small a footprint in the
          market as possible.<br/><br/>

          Only FUND customers can and may deploy institutional size capital with Formula Stocks,
          or capital on the behalf of others, as it does require specific technology not
          available with other products and specific fine-tuning to AUM.
