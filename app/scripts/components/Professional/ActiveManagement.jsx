          Formula Stocks does more than select equities. It includes an active management system,
          which actively buys, holds, and sells equities when deemed most beneficial.
          Active management adds value. On a portfolio of random stocks,
          active management typically adds around 2,4% to annual performance.
          On a well selected portfolio of attractive stocks, active management typically adds around
          6% to annual performance, compared to passive management.
