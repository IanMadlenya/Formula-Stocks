            Formula Stocks is an information provider, not an investment advisory service or
            a registered investment advisor and does not offer individual investment advice.
            Unless otherwise specified, all return figures shown above are for illustrative purposes only.
            Actual returns in the future will vary greatly and depend on personal and market circumstances.
            No representation is being made that you are likely to achieve profits
            or losses similar to those shown.<br/><br/>

            Formula Stocks does not manage client funds, but acts solely as an information
            and technology supplier. Formula Stocks does not purport
            to tell which securities individual customers should buy or sell for themselves.
            Formula Stocks’ purchase and sales recommendations are not solicitations to buy or sell,
            but rather information you can use as a starting point for doing additional
            independent research in order to allow you to form your own opinion regarding investments
            and make your own informed decisions.<br/><br/>

            Formula Stocks assumes no responsibility or liability for your investment results.
            You understand and acknowledge that there is a high degree of risk involved in
            investing in securities. This service does not constitute an offer,
            a solicitation to buy a security, or to open a brokerage account.<br/><br/>

            Past results of any investment system are not necessarily indicative of future results.
            It should not be assumed that the systems presented in these products will be profitable
            or that they cannot result in losses. In addition, information, system output, articles,
            and other features of our products are provided for educational and informational purposes
            only and should not be construed as investment advice. Accordingly,
            you should not rely solely on this information in making any investment.
            Unless experienced as an investor, one should check with a licensed financial advisor to
            determine the suitability of any investment and/or read relevant stock prospectuses.
            Formula Stocks portfolios may or may not be adequately diversified for any particular
            risk profile as the required level of diversification differs from individual to  individual,
            so set your own individual maximum position size accordingly.<br/><br/>

            The period 2009-2016 reflects actual investment results. Other period statistics are
            the result of back-testing the strategies. Back-tested performance results have certain
            inherent limitations, as they could potentially be designed with some benefit of hindsight,
            even though every effort has been taken to avoid such risk. Unlike an actual
            live investment period (such as 2009-2016), back-tested results do not represent actual
            trading and may not be impacted by brokerage and other slippage fees. Also since transactions
            may or may not actually have been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for impact,
            if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of market liquidity or level of participation.<br/><br/>

            Formula Stocks business analytics depends on the accuracy of the published accounts of
            public corporations. Such accuracy may from time to time be less than ideal.
            Formula Stocks strategies evolve and improve on a recurring basis,
            and any result and statistic is therefore subject to change without notice.
            Formula Stocks employees may or may not own equities mentioned in the service.
