        <p>
          The Formula Stocks team would like to thank you for signing up and help you get
          started.<br/><br/>

          Our buy and sell signals are updated every week. The model portfolios are updated on
          the first weekday of every month.<br/><br/>

          Our service requires a little patience and a long term perspective. It occasionally
          happens that our stock selections goes straight up. But most of the time, they won't.
          The average holding period is 2.3 years, but varies a lot.<br/><br/>

          We hope you'll enjoy it. Let us know if you have any questions.
