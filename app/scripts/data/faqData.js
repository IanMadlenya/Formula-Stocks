**What do I get with a Formula Stocks subscription?**

  With a Formula Stocks subscription you get access to a secure dashboard (login area accessible via our website). Here you can follow the development in our portfolio of carefully selected stocks, and on a weekly or monthly basis, according to your wishes, we provide new stock purchase and sale recommendations (and additional information about the given stocks), which you may choose to use to buy/sell stocks via your own broker/bank.

**How do I begin to invest?**

  It depends on how you wish to use Formula Stocks. There are four different ways.

  1.  Mirror the model portfolio, and update your stock portfolio once a month accordingly.
  2.  Use Formula Stocks recommendations when they appear and use them for new positions in your portfolio.
  3.  A combination. You can choose to apply a percentage, for instance 40%, to the model portfolio now, earmarking 20% for the first 3 months’ new recommendations, and keeping 40% in cash for later. This approach is a belt-and-braces way of easing slowly into a position over time.
  4.  Lastly, you can make your own analysis of either portfolio positions or recommendations, which, if you are a quite experienced investor, may be a very interesting alternative. You then use Formula Stocks effectively as a high-quality generator of vetted investment ideas, or a specialized stock screener.

**How often are new stocks recommended for purchase or sale?**

  New recommendations appear on a weekly basis if and when the market offers them. Accessing these once a month is fully sufficient. The number of weekly recommendations depends very much on current market conditions, and from time to time the recommendations may be the same for a while. Formula Stocks looks for great opportunities in the markets; sometimes we find a few (less than five), sometimes we find many (more than 50). The holding period is long term, from 300 to 1,200 days.

**What does “cash allocation” percentages in purchase recommendations signify?**

  Each month, if you choose to mirror our model portfolio, you deploy a percentage of the available cash into a new stock. Please note that this is not a percentage of the entire portfolio’s net worth, but only of freely available cash.

**How many new investment candidates are available?**

  The availability of new investment candidates is a function of the available investments we can locate in the markets with a sufficient degree of certainty. We buy stocks like you buy steaks in the supermarket. We generally prefer high quality and low prices. The market does not always accommodate our preferences, and the number of candidates does vary greatly with the price level of the general market. If pickings are slim, we may prefer a partial cash position for a while.

**How often do I need to think about my portfolio?**

  You need to check for any recommendations once a month or alternatively rebalance your portfolio once a month. At least, if you want your portfolio to match the Formula Stocks portfolio exactly. This is not a requirement, though. A loosely managed portfolio or simply single, handpicked investments can perform just as well. We recommend a monthly checkup. If your personality is more in tune with frequent attention to investments, our purchase recommendations are updated on a weekly basis, while our sales recommendations are updated once a month. Our strategies trade only once a month. (This is to allow one full month for accumulation or distribution of larger positions).

**Do I enter my other portfolio positions in the app/website?**

  No. Formula Stocks is not aware of your actual positions. Formula Stocks displays an optimized model portfolio per plan and tracks its performance over time.

**What does a Formula Stocks purchase recommendation include?**

  Purchase recommendations are vetted from a quantitative, strategy, value, growth, and business analytics standpoint. When you receive a recommendation, you can access 10 data points mostly related to relative price, expected return, expected growth rate, etc. Our Business Analytics, however, analyzes more than 400 primary data points for many thousands of stocks every day. We do not write standard analyst reports, as these tend to be influenced by human biases.

**How does Formula Stocks compare to passive index-investing?**

  Extremely favorably. Passive investment strategies, or index-investing, is simply investing in more or less all stocks available (or a subset of these). The outcome can only be average by definition. Since it is a given, that out of 5.000 stocks, 1 is the best, and 1 is the worst, and all of the other fall somewhere in between, and since it is possible to quantify to a reasonable extent, which is in either end of this spectrum, ahead of time, it is a deeply flawed strategy to simply invest in all stocks. Surely, it makes sense to invest more intelligently, allocating capital towards good businesses and avoiding bad businesses where possible. A superficial argument can be made for passive investment on the basis of not requiring resources or any thinking hence low fees, and for scaling well. But for informed participants, this argument is negated completely by the performance attainable by an active strategy such as Formula Stocks which equally operates with a low fee structure. It simply makes no sense to achieve simply an average return, when it is possible to achieve an above-average return, net of fees.

**Which and how many stocks are covered by your service?**

  We do not supply a full list of all the potential stocks analyzed by our systems. It covers many thousands of stocks, however, ranging from micro-cap to mega-cap companies in all sectors with varying geography.

**How much can I expect in investment returns?**

  Formula Stocks can, like everyone else, not answer this question. We can optimize the odds for you to outperform the market averages. At any rate, the market return going forward is inversely proportional to the current price level. When the general price level is high, you should expect lower returns forward from any form of investment. Conversely, when the general price level is low, expect higher returns going forward. Historically, we have tended to outperform the market averages in both bear and bull markets. What we do is to improve the odds quite significantly. We do not control the outcome. The longer one is invested with Formula Stocks, however, the better the odds of success, as the outcomes converge more and more with the positively skewed odds over time.

**What about volatility?**

  Formula Stocks selections typically have smaller drawdowns over time than the S&P 500 and higher net returns. But due to smaller portfolio sizes and more concentration, the results are also likely to be more volatile in the shorter term. Refer to the Omega risk/reward benchmark found elsewhere on our website for more detail.

**Can I expect a quick return on my investment?**

  No. The creation of business value takes time. Formula Stocks does not speculate on timing-related issues. We buy real businesses when it makes good sense to buy them, and we hold them until sufficient value has been created or a better opportunity reveals itself. This means that we are sometimes early, or that we do not buy at the exact bottom; thus, one may well experience an initial negative return. In fact, it may sometimes take several years for an investment position to turn from a negative return to a positive return. Or it can happen very quickly. Either way, patience and the ability to stick to the plan, enduring some volatility at times, are significant elements of achieving long-term success in any form of investing. This experience is well known to long-term value investors: Short-term volatility preceding long-term gain. Please refer to our online video visualization of returns over time.

**What risks do I incur when investing with Formula Stocks?**

  It is difficult to give a precise answer to this question. Generally, one incurs the risk of investing in stocks in a general sense. However, this risk is somewhat reduced, based upon the fact that Formula Stocks recommendations have better than average odds of success and a reasonable margin of safety. At the same time, our portfolios are more concentrated than, say, the S&P 500. Consequently, our portfolios are likely to be more volatile. However, we do not consider volatility as risk, in a strict sense, although some investors do. (We have yet to meet an investor who frowns upon volatility to the upside when experiencing outsized gains). Please refer to the Omega graph found on our website for a comparison of risk/reward relative to the general market. Formula Stocks’ risk level may additionally be lower than the general markets, because our methods at times may hold a cash component for strategic purposes. Any investment involves risk. See our Terms and Conditions.

**What can I save using Formula Stocks instead of other products?**

  Formula Stocks offers a low, flat, and transparent fee, which does not scale with volume. What you can save depends on what you otherwise pay in fees. This can be complicated to calculate, as many funds have a number of different costs, some of which can be grouped into sales charges, expense ratios, transaction commissions, and redemption fees. Hedge funds and alternative investment vehicles often include a large performance fee as well, and ETFs have trading costs in addition to expense ratios. Formula Stocks is usually the less expensive method, sometimes by a very large factor. It also depends on the amount of capital deployed. From a saver’s perspective, the Formula Stocks model can be seen as the IKEA model of the investment world. You buy prefabricated parts (strategy and technology), do the final assembly yourself (purchase and sale of equities), and obtain very significant savings in the process.

**Do you offer an investment fund/ETF with which one can invest directly?**

  No, not at this point in time.

**How do I pay for membership?**

  Usually with a credit card, although other options exist for BUSINESS and FUND members.

**Is there a trial period available?**

  We offer a free trial for a one-month period with full access to our BASIC plan.

**Is there a minimum period of subscription?**

  No. BASIC and PREMIUM are monthly subscriptions, whereas BUSINESS and FUND are yearly subscriptions. Once a period begins, it is non-refundable. You can cancel your subscription any time before a new period starts.

**Do I have to choose the portfolio suggested by Formula Stocks, or can I continue with my current portfolio?**

  This is entirely up to you. You can freely mix and match with any other portfolio, stock, or product.

**Can your products be used in any country?**

  Yes, absolutely. We cater to an international audience, and the stocks we prefer are available for purchase in all countries.

**Is your stock selection USA only?**

  No. Formula Stocks can be used from anywhere in the world. It works with a majority of public US companies, a significant part of Canadian companies, and a larger number of international companies with an ADR (American Depositary Receipt). These are international companies which trade on the US exchanges, as if they were US stocks, denominated in USD, even though the company itself may be located in Peru, Switzerland, or Germany, for instance, and trade in the local currency of this particular country. In practical terms, Formula Stocks analyzes international stocks, usually a similar subset to what you might find traded on US exchanges. This is to ensure the availability of all stocks, to all members, no matter their geographical location.

**What about currencies?**

  We use USD as a base currency for the sake of simplicity. No matter what your local currency is, you can easily use Formula Stocks anywhere in the world.

**Does Formula Stocks offer direct brokerage services or investment advisory services?**

  No.

**How does the Formula Stocks portfolios tie in with my existing asset allocation?**

  The Formula Stocks plans differ, but with 94 different strategies used in total they involve sound diversification both in terms of stocks, sectors, and strategies. Formula Stocks includes equities from all sectors. As you have full access to the Formula Stocks portfolio, you can judge the exact portfolio composition for yourself. Adding high-probability investment ideas should be a plus for any portfolio. You can either run your Formula Stocks portfolio as a 1:1 mirror, use recommendations on an ongoing basis, which will result in a slightly different portfolio, or cherry pick specific investments only, thus using Formula Stocks as a very advanced stock screener.

**Does Formula Stocks short stocks?**

  No.

**The majority of active investment managers are unable to beat the market averages in historical analysis. Why is Formula Stocks different?**

  We offer something that most managers simply do not have access to. Our proprietary IIT™ quantifies the risks and reward, odds of success, and the presumed future alpha of every investment candidate. In fact, it quantifies over 400 data points about every single business that we analyze. From this we are able to extract knowledge to beat the market averages using the scientific method. This proprietary technology, 14 years in the making, is a machine learning-based expert system, which runs on a supercomputer and possesses knowledge that is not generally available. This knowledge is a simplistic form of artificial intelligence, geared entirely toward business analysis. Our BUSINESS product, for instance, has historically surpassed the market returns (as defined by the S&P 500) 88% of the time on a yearly basis. Future investment returns are unknown, however, and we make no representation that any particular level of performance will be achieved.

**Why are there fewer current portfolio positions than indicated as average?**

  The average number of concurrent portfolio positions over time are for Fund: 128, Business: 52, Premium: 102, Basic: 118. However, unlike an index fund Formula Stocks does not invest in stocks regardless of conditions. We only invest, when we see attractive probabilities for success. This means that the cheaper the markets get, of course the more diverse the portfolio becomes. Conversely, when the markets are expensive, fewer good investments can be located, and portfolio sizes decrease. Toward a price peak the number of positions may dwindle, as they are sold (for a profit), converted into cash, preparing for the next market cycle, when an inevitable correction materializes, and the portfolio once again expands.

**How is the model portfolio updated?**

  We recalibrate our model portfolio once a month. This involves purchasing new positions, selling existing positions, and adjusting position sizes. Once the decisions have been made, we allow for one full month to perform the actual trading required; this month is our "trading window". This is to allow slow and tempered accumulation or distribution of larger positions, without affecting market price in a significant manner. By using a longer time period, the price impact can be minimized to a reasonable extent. The recommendations are slightly different, as these are updated weekly, and they may change in content more frequently. A recommendation may appear some time before it is included in the model portfolio.

**What are the size limits/AUM limits?**

  Memberships BASIC and PREMIUM are designed for retail usage, with which relatively low individual AUMs are intrinsically expected. BUSINESS is designed for medium size capital, typically a corporation, CEO, CFO, accredited or sophisticated investor, etc., and institutional capital is not allowed. BUSINESS is a focused membership, and not widely diversified. FUND is designed for institutional capital, capable of very large AUMs. It is important not to attempt to use retail or BUSINESS memberships with institutional size capital. It will not work. FUND is designed to maintain an adequate diversification level, with a significant level of underlying liquidity, which can satisfy institutional requirements.

**What about institutional capital?**

  Only our FUND membership is designed to handle institutional capital. It should cope with AUM sizes well beyond the largest typical fund AUMs. FUND is designed to maintain an adequate diversification level, with significant liquidity available for market operations, which can satisfy institutional requirements. Contact us for further information.

**How can you state results all the way back to 1970, when Formula Stocks development first began in 2003?**

  Our methods are fully quantifiable and built upon a timeless investment philosophy. This means that Formula Stocks methods will work on any opportunity set (any set of available stocks at any point in history, both past and future), and that the exact results of the past can be quantified with great accuracy. In principle, it is possible to calculate Formula Stocks’ results for as many years as company reports contain sufficient detail to provide enough information to make prudent business decisions. 1970 is an arbitrary starting point. Our input is the market opportunity set regardless of time or macro. Our formula is our complex expert system based on sound business logic. The output is a set of fully quantifiable business decisions. Tracking the financial results of executing these decisions is both easy and reasonably accurate. While pre-2009 results as such are calculated, post-2009 results are not. These have been actual, inasmuch as the recommendations have been performed in real time, and the future – as it appeared back then in 2009 – has proven a rather exact match of our expectations. We have profited greatly from investments carried out on the recommendations of Formula Stocks since its release in 2009.

**Do you recommend stocks with which you have any form of affiliation or interest?**

  Absolutely not. Formula Stocks operates under very strict ethical standards. We will never recommend anything in which we have a vested interest. We receive no compensation from any parties. Formula Stocks employees are allowed to invest using the products for personal retirement purposes, alongside members through the website.
