                Historically, 89-92% of our recommendations have been successful. If you had bought random
                high-quality stocks, only approx. 59% of these would have earned a positive return. A
                staggering difference.

            We specialize in high-probability investments â€“ a high probability of long-term gain combined
            with a low probability of loss. We prefer to buy good businesses at fair prices with a margin
            of safety, shielding us from some downside, while enjoying the upside of owning businesses
            that earn a meaningful return on capital.
