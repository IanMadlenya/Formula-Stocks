          For institutional capital, liquidity is more important than performance.
          Our FUND product reflects this, it is designed to dynamically scale its
          recommandations towards a specific AUM target provided by our members,
          to always ensure ample liquidity for a specific size, without affecting a
          significant market impact, and for optimal perfomance. Our method of
          accumulation and distribution works towards leaving as small a footprint in the
          market as possible.<br/><br/>

          Only FUND customers may deploy institutional size capital with Formula Stocks, or
          capital on behalf of others, as it does require specific technology not available
          with other products and specific fine-tuning to match customer AUMs. FUND is
          tailormade to client specifications. Contact us for more information.
